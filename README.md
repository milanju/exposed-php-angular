# Barcodes Exposed

This is another implementation of my [Barcodes Exposed](https://github.com/milanju/barcodesexposed) Project.
The original implementation runs client only, which obviously exposes the Battle Net API key.
Here I'm doing the API call from the server with a simple PHP Script & loading the table with Angular.
